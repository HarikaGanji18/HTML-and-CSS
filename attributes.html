     <p>Doraemon is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F.
      Fujio1. The story revolves around a robotic cat named Doraemon, who
      travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named Nobita
      Nobi1. The name "Doraemon" roughly translates to "stray" and is written in
      a mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana and Hiragana2. Doraemon is a
      big deal in Japanese culture and is often compared to Mickey Mouse3.</p>
